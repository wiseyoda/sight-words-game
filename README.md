## Overview

Sight Words Adventure transforms the traditionally tedious task of learning sight words into an engaging, story-driven experience. Children aged 4-6 help their favorite characters solve problems by building sentences, progressing through themed campaigns while mastering the **Dolch Sight Words** - the 133 most common words that make up 50-75% of children's books.

### Why This Exists

- **Flashcards are boring** - Kids need games, not drills
- **Narrative creates meaning** - Words become tools to solve problems
- **AI enables infinite content** - Never run out of fresh challenges
- **Parents need visibility** - Track progress without hovering

### Target Experience

## Development

### Development Phases

| Phase | Focus | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **1** | Core Engine - Sentence builder, AI validation, TTS | ✅ Nearly Complete |
| **2** | Polish - Animations, story map, feedback system | ⏳ Planned |
| **3** | AI & Admin - Dashboard, content generators | ⏳ Planned |
| **4** | Themes - Three launch themes, sound design | ⏳ Planned |
| **5** | Beyond - Mini-games, additional content | ⏳ Future |

### Phase 1 Progress (91% Complete)

- [x] Project setup (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind)
- [x] Database schema and seeding (49 words, 10 sentences)
- [x] Sentence builder with tap-to-place
- [x] Full drag-and-drop support (word bank ↔ slots ↔ reorder)
- [x] AI validation via OpenAI (flexible, not strict)
- [x] TTS audio for words (HTML5 Audio + OpenAI TTS)
- [x] Sentence audio playback on correct submission
- [x] "Hear my sentence" preview button
- [ ] Basic admin CRUD ← Current

### Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # Run ESLint (needs initial Next.js config)
npm run typecheck    # Run TypeScript checks
npm test             # Run tests
npm run db:push      # Push schema to database
npm run db:studio    # Open Drizzle Studio
npm run db:seed      # Seed with initial data
```

### Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Validation** | AI-powered (LLM) | Flexible word order, semantic understanding |
| **Input** | Tap-to-place primary | More intuitive for young children |
| **Audio** | On-demand TTS | No manual recording, infinite words |
| **Failure** | Encouragement only | No "game over", preserve confidence |
| **Offline** | Not supported | Simplifies architecture, requires AI |
