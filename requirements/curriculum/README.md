## Why Dolch Words?

The Dolch Word List (created by Edward William Dolch in 1936) contains **220 service words** + 95 nouns that make up **50-75% of all words in children's books**.

### Benefits

- **Research-Based**: Proven effective for early literacy
- **Standardized**: Same list used by schools
- **Progressive**: Natural difficulty progression
- **Comprehensive**: Covers most high-frequency words

### Our Scope

We use the first three levels (133 words):

| Level | Word Count | Target Age |
|-------|------------|------------|
| Pre-Primer | 40 words | Pre-K to K |
| Primer | 52 words | Kindergarten |
| First Grade | 41 words | 1st Grade |

## Mastery Concept

### How It Works

Each word is tracked individually:
- Times seen
- Times correct on first try
- Times hints were used
- Last seen date

### Mastery Levels

| Level | Criteria | Visual |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **New** | Seen 0-2 times | Gray |
| **Learning** | Seen 3-5×, <70% first-try | Yellow |
| **Familiar** | Seen 5+×, 70-90% first-try | Blue |
| **Mastered** | Seen 10+×, >90% first-try | Green ⭐ |

## Adaptive System

The game adjusts based on performance:

### Struggling Child

| Trigger | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Word missed 3+ times | More practice with that word |
| Many hints used | Easier scaffolding next mission |
| Long pauses | Auto-suggest hints |

### Excelling Child

| Trigger | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Many first-try correct | Reduce word frequency |
| Fast completion | Offer challenge mode |
| All 3 stars | Unlock bonus content |
